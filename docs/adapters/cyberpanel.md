# CyberPanel Adapter

**Status:** 📋 Planned — not yet implemented. [Contribute this adapter →](https://github.com/NowSquare/VoxelSwarm/issues)

## Overview

[CyberPanel](https://cyberpanel.net/) is a web hosting panel powered by OpenLiteSpeed (or LiteSpeed Enterprise). The adapter would use the [CyberPanel API](https://cyberpanel.net/docs/api-guide/) to manage websites and subdomains.

## Planned Implementation

- **createSubdomain:** Create a child domain via CyberPanel API
- **removeSubdomain:** Delete the child domain
- **pauseSubdomain:** Suspend the website
- **resumeSubdomain:** Unsuspend the website

## Required Configuration

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `cyberpanel_hostname` | CyberPanel server hostname |
| `cyberpanel_port` | CyberPanel port (usually 8090) |
| `cyberpanel_username` | CyberPanel admin username |
| `cyberpanel_password` | CyberPanel admin password |

## Notes

CyberPanel uses OpenLiteSpeed by default. VoxelSite is compatible with LiteSpeed/OpenLiteSpeed, but adapter-level configuration may differ from Nginx/Apache setups. The `.htaccess` file included with VoxelSite is supported by LiteSpeed.
