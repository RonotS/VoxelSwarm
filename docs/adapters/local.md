# Filesystem Adapter (Local / Custom Path)

**Status:** ✅ Working

The Filesystem adapter deploys instances directly to a folder on disk. No subdomain management, no web server configuration — you handle routing yourself. Ideal for local development (Herd, Valet), testing, or custom setups where you manage your own web server.

## How It Works

- **createSubdomain:** Logs the instance registration only. The provisioner already copied the files and no web server configuration is performed.
- **removeSubdomain:** Logs the removal (directory cleanup is handled by the provisioner)
- **pauseSubdomain / resumeSubdomain:** Logs the action (no web server changes)
- **verify:** Checks that the configured instances root path exists and is writable

The adapter focuses on filesystem operations only. If you need automatic subdomain routing, use the Nginx, Forge, cPanel, or Plesk adapter instead.

## Configuration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Adapter | `local` |
| `instances_root` | Absolute path where instance directories are created (optional; defaults to `storage/instances/`) |

Set the instances root path in **Deployment → Adapter** when `Filesystem (Local)` is selected.

## Setup

### For local development (Herd / Valet)

1. Install [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) (macOS) or [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet)
2. Set `base_domain` to your local domain (e.g., `voxelsite-swarm.test`)
3. Select the `Filesystem` adapter in Deployment
4. Optionally configure a custom instances root path
5. Provision a test instance

Herd/Valet handle DNS and SSL for `*.test` domains automatically when symlinks are present.

### For custom server setups

1. Select the `Filesystem` adapter in Deployment
2. Set the instances root path to your desired deployment directory (e.g., `/var/www/instances/`)
3. Configure your web server to serve each subdirectory as a separate site
4. Provision instances — files are deployed to `{instances_root}/{slug}/`

## Limitations

- No automatic subdomain creation — you manage web server config yourself
- No SSL provisioning — handle certificates through your own setup
- "Test Connection" verifies directory writability only
